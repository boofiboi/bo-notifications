# **bo-notifications**
"Customizable" notification script for your FiveM server, that's fully open source and modifiable

This script is not yet ready for deployment on any server.

There's no usable events, nor any user-facing commands that you can use.

# PLEASE DON'T INSTALL THIS SCRIPT YET!!!!!


### Todo:

- [x] Basic notification functions
- [ ] GUI for configuring the script (Probably wont do?)
- [ ] Custom sounds made by me (I don't know how though.)
- [ ] User friendly tutorial on how to use this script
- [ ] Fully finish the script
- [ ] Proper MatV3 design?
